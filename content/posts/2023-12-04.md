# OpenIdConnect  
This github project is Java-Spring for OpenID-Connect: https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server

Hell, if I have to run a server for this, why not Spring-Boot? Hmm....   

# Hugo

lets get some taxonomies working... 
OK, working. 
But, I don't think I have bootstrap working on this site yet...
