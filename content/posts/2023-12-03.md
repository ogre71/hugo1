I added the improved markdown viewer to visual studio code. 

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview

I was after checkbox functionality: 

- [ ] I see a checkbox  

This was the code for that: 
```markdown 
- [ ] I see a checkbox
```

I am going to make a todo list for Kermoda. The checkbox didn't render right in visual studio code. Now it does. Success. 

I also see some other very cool markdown additions that were included. 

### Markdown Emoji

:tooth:  
Markdown for tooth:
```markdown emoji 
:tooth: 
```

:neutral_face:
:peach:

Neat, but not neat enough to be noteworthy on its own.

### Markdown Mermaid support

It has been some time since I messed with mermaid. I'm glad that time wasn't wasted. I still retain some vestigial knowledge of what it is. :)
:D
Cool. It does render the most basic emoji appropriately. :)  

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

````
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
````
(I used quadrupile `ticks here to encade that code block so I could include the triple ticks.)  

This works too:  
```
:::mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
:::
```

:::mermaid

    note for Duck "can fly\ncan swim\ncan dive\ncan help in debugging"
    Animal <|-- Fish
    Animal <|-- Zebra
    Animal : +int age
    Animal : +String gender
    Animal: +isMammal()
    Animal: +mate()
    class Duck{
        +String beakColor
        +swim()
        +quack()
    }
    class Fish{
        -int sizeInFeet
        -canEat()
    }
    class Zebra{
        +bool is_wild
        +run()
    }

This is way better than I thought.
